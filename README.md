## üåü Why This Plugin?

Modern AI assistants are incredibly helpful for game development, but they need context about your project structure. Instead of manually copying code snippets, this plugin gives AI a complete understanding of your:

- Game architecture and design patterns
- Current implementation details  
- Configuration and settings
- Relationships between systems

This leads to much more accurate and helpful AI assistance!
